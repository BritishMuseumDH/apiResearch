Also, a slightly more restricted, but useful API is the Transport For London API which I used in a tech demo of offline available Tube journey planning and so on.","I'd love to be able to build an offline available guide to the museum, where you can type in the name of the thing you want, and the application returns information about the thing, related items within the collection, and links to other museums who may have other bits. So searching for the Sutton Hoo helmet could return other items from the ship burial, and any items that aren't in the British Museum (not sure if there's anything from Sutton Hoo the Museum doesn't have), but yeah, that kind of thing.

A way to explore the data on the web, but without relying on the layout of the museum in a Street View kind of style, would be really cool too.

I quite like the idea of being able to explore the items that aren't on display in an easier way, and (if possible) be able to make bookings or inquire as to whether they are going to be on show. My girlfriend is an avid historical costumer, and being able to see some of the things that aren't on display because they aren't as visually interesting as other exhibits would be great.
